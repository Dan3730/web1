<h3>Denial-Of-Service Attack</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
  <td>
    Attacks and floods networks, systems, servers,or networks 
    with traffic. With the traffic flooding the network 
    this causes legitmate traffic requests are unable to process.

<h3>SQL Injection</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
  <td>
    Structure Query Language (SQL) injection happens when the atacker 
    inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server 
    to reveal information it normally wouldn't. SQL injections can also simply 
    when an attacker enters malicous code in a website search box.

<h3>Zero-Day exploit</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
  <td>
    Hits after a network vulnerability is announced but before a patch or 
    solution is implemented. Attackers target the disclosed vulnerability 
    durning this window of time. Zero-Day vulnerability threat detection 
    requires constant awarness.

<h3>DNS Tunneling</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
  <td>
    DNS tunneling utilizes the DNS protocol to communicate non-DNS 
    traffic over port 53. It sends HTTP and other protocol traffic 
    over DNS. There are various, legitimate reasons to utilize DNS 
    tunneling. However, there are also malicious reasons to use DNS 
    Tunneling VPN services. They can be used to disguise outbound 
    traffic as DNS, concealing data that is typically shared through an 
    internet connection. For malicious use, DNS requests are manipulated 
    to exfiltrate data from a compromised system to the attacker’s 
    infrastructure. It can also be used for command and control callbacks 
    from the attacker’s infrastructure to a compromised system.
